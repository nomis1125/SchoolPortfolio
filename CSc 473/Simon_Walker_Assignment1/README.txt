CSc 473 Assignment 1

Part 1 is mostly complete. Unsure if Arc Length or drawing of the spline is accurate.
_______

Part 2 I was able to animate tank on spline and missile to follow its tangent.

Could not figure out how to make contact. Or how to stop it when they do.
Unable to get quaternion and allignment working. 
Easy ease is kinda implemented. Slower during first and last 10% of line. Faster else where.
-Note, hard to see as to how I was able to move the object.
Speed can be set but under 100.
